In this directory, I will be analyzing the data provided in the paper, "The evolution of gene expression levels in mammmalian organs"

I will analyze it in three ways. 

1) species phylogenies: I will use a species phylogeny; using the known taxonomic relationship between the included species.

2) gene_family_phylogenies: I will construct phylogenies for each gene family (sequence).

3) gene_expression_distance_phylogenies: I will construct distance-based phylogenies using spearman's correlation.
